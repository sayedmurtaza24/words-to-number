# Words To Number

## About
It's a little function I wrote in my spare time that converts 
written numbers in words from english language to actual numbers.

## Features to be added
* Add support for many languages
* Add support for more numbers (currently upto quintillions only)
* Optimize even more!
* Make it an actual module
* What else you think?

## Supported inputs
I used the _Short American_ form [here](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_for_large_numbers)
but changing it european wouldn't be so hard! ;)
Example of supported inputs to the function are:
* twenty two
* twenty
* one hundred and forty two
* one hundred and eleven
* three thousand five hundred
* three thousand five hundred and seventy two
* three thousand five hundred and ten
* three hundred thousand six hundred
* three hundred thousand six hundred and eleven
* three hundred eleven thousand six hundred and twenty-two
* five hundred million three hundred thousand and twenty 
* five hundred forty two million three hundred thousand and twenty
* five hundred million three hundred thirty two thousand one hundred twenty

The algorithm ignores spaces, dashes and the word 'and' in the phrase!
